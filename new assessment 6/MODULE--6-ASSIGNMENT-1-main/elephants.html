                            <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
    <p>Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. Two 
    species are traditionally recognised, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana)
    and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), although some evidence suggests that
    African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species 
    (L. africana and L. cyclotis respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout
     sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is the only 
     surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the
     order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons. Male African
      elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of
     4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb).</p>
     <p>All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long
     trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting
    water and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve 
    as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear 
    flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry 
    their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while 
   Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>
   <p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including
    savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
