          <P>is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the simians. </P>
          <P>Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are mainly active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys.</P>
